# Ecological Disaster Tweet Detection Project

### Overview

The Ecological Disaster Tweet Detection Project is a data science initiative aimed at leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and classify tweets related to ecological disasters. The project utilizes machine learning models to categorize tweets into relevant categories, enabling timely response and action in mitigating ecological crises.

### Motivation

The increasing frequency and severity of ecological disasters underscore the need for effective monitoring and response systems. Social media platforms like Twitter serve as valuable sources of real-time information during such events. This project seeks to harness the power of machine learning to automatically detect and classify tweets discussing ecological disasters, facilitating rapid response and resource allocation.

### Project Structure

- **Data Collection**: Twitter API is used to collect tweets containing keywords related to ecological disasters, forming the dataset for model training and evaluation.

- **Preprocessing**: Text preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization, are applied to clean and standardize the tweet text.

- **Model Development**: Machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are trained on the preprocessed tweet data to classify tweets into relevant disaster categories.

- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess classification performance and identify areas for improvement.

- **Deployment**: The trained model can be deployed as a web application or integrated into existing systems for real-time tweet classification and monitoring.
